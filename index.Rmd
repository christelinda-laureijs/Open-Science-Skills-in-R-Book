# About

Hello everyone! We would like to start off with a quick introduction to the concept of open science and also what you can expect during this workshop series.

## QUICK INTRODUCTION TO OPEN SCIENCE

You might be wondering: **what is open science?** It is the process of making the content and process of producing evidence and claims transparent and accessible to others. This involves making the entire research process - from project conceptualization to publication - open to all and transparent. There are a number of techniques that you can work on to improve transparency and reproducibility (the ability to repeat the same project and obtain the same results) of your work. In this workshop series, we will be covering a few skills that will help you advance science using open practices.

We don't have too much time to review the importance of open science practices and its philosophy in this workshop series, because we are focusing on skill building. **But, we encourage you to learn more through reading and engaging with additional resources on this topic. Here are a few we find helpful:**

* [A Manifesto for Reproducible Science by Munaf√≤ et al. 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-016-0021)

* Today we will not be talking about preregistration, which is simply specifying your research plan in advance of your study and submitting it to a registry. This is a important first step of a research project that adheres to open science practice. For more details, check out [this website.](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg?_ga=2.263330764.1195627208.1585935801-1853960792.1572623623.)

* [The Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/open-science) also has a number of useful resources, and they also host their own repsoitory where data, etc. can be hosted and shared with others called the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/)



## Usage 

Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`.

The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

## Render book

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
