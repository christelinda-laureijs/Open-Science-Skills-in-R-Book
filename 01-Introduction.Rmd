# What is Open Science? {-}

You might be wondering: **"What is open science?"** It is the process of making the content and process of producing evidence and claims transparent and accessible to others. This involves making the entire research process - from project conceptualization to publication - open to all and transparent. There are a number of techniques that you can work on to improve transparency and reproducibility (the ability to repeat the same project and obtain the same results) of your work. In this workshop series, we will be covering a few skills that will help you advance science using open practices.

We don't have too much time to review the importance of open science practices and its philosophy in this workshop series, because we are focusing on skill building. **But, we encourage you to learn more through reading and engaging with additional resources on this topic. Here are a few we find helpful:**

<!-- * Today we will not be talking about preregistration, which is simply specifying your research plan in advance of your study and submitting it to a registry. This is a important first step of a research project that adheres to open science practice.

<!-- * [The Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/open-science) also has a number of useful resources, and they also host their own repsoitory where data, etc. can be hosted and shared with others called the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) -->
