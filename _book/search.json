Welcome Introducing Tidy WorkflowYou learn set software (R, RStudio, LaTex) R packages help data analysis writing. guide provide support needed installation process. also discuss practice “tidy” project data management strategies, well tidy coding practices. skills help organization research project, collaborations, ensuring transparency broad impact.2. Git itWe help get set use Git R. Git version control tool\nhelp implement “tidy” project data management strategies\ndiscussed first workshop. ’ll cover creating repository, tracking\nchanges, exploring history project, collaborating GitHub.\n’ll leave understanding can track changes Git, share\nwork GitHub, reuse open code, contribute open projects.3.
