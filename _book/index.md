This book is part of a workshop series led by Christelinda Laureijs, Elizabeth Stregger, and Dr. Julia Riley. We are a group of enthusiastic R coders with a passion for open science and educational outreach! We created this book for three reasons:

* To provide curious learners with a useful resource beyond the workshops.
* To give a quick overview to anyone who wants to get started with setting up R, managing their projects, and writing papers with R.
* To gather tips, tricks and links to other resources all in one document.

## Workshops

This book is divided into three chapters associated with each workshop:

**1. Welcome and Introducing a Tidy Workflow**

These skills will help in with organization for your research project,
collaborations, and ensuring transparency and broad impact.

* How to set up R, RStudio, LaTeX and required packages
* Tidy projects and data management strategies
* Tidy coding practices
* Organizing your research project

**2. Git with it**

After this section, you'll have an understanding of how you can track changes
with Git, share your work with GitHub, reuse open code, and contribute to open
projects.

* Setting up Git on your computer
* Creating a repository
* Tracking changes to your project
* Exploring the history of a project
* Collaborating in GitHub

**3. Reproducible Scientific Writing with R**

All the skills from the previous chapters come together in this last section.
You will learn how to write a paper completely within R - no more copying and
pasting between different platforms!

* Creating publication-ready figures and tables
* Managing citations
* Organizing a paper into chapters
* Customizing your paper
* Extract statistical values to insert directly into the paper

## Files

Throughout this book, we will provide links to files in the [GitHub repository for this book](https://github.com/christelinda-laureijs/Open-Science-Skills-in-R-Book). To make it easier to work with files, we have sometimes attached files directly in the book. Here is an example of a `.csv` file that you can download:
